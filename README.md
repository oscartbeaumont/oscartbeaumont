### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I build projects using [Preact](https://preactjs.com), [Go](https://golang.org), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and any other language I feel like using.

I work extensivly with the [Windows Mobile Device Management Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm).

I also [try](https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/the-end-of-indie-web-browsers) to develop an app called [ElectronPlayer](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/ElectronPlayer).

You can email me if you are interested in hiring me.
